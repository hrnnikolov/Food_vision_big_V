This project uses the food101 dataset. The modelling, training and data preparation is done using Python and Pytorch.
The created model takes the uploaded/selected image, transforms it and makes a prediction of what food is on it.
The visual part of the project is made using the gradio library and uploaded to huggingface so that everyone can go to the [link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hrnnikolov/foodvision_big_v) and check it out for themselves.
Here you can see the Food Vision project, which makes a prediction based on an image.
To the right of the image you can see the predictions in percentages.
